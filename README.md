Using docker compose to create PHPMyAdmin page which is conected to mysql DB then using NGINX to access it remotly.After that using Jenkins to make CI/CD.Before all that I used ansible to configure and setup the environment.I used ansible-galaxy to install nginx role , special thanks to ansible community.
